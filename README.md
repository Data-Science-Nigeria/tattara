The DSN AI Data Collection App is a web-based platform designed to streamline and enhance data entry, validation, and integration using AI assistance. This application will go beyond DHIS2-specific integration by supporting two backend modes: 

1. DHIS2 Mode – Direct integration with DHIS2 instances using its API.
2. Generic DB Mode – Configurable connectors for standard relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, etc.) and other system APIs.

The app leverages AI/ML models for automated data validation, context-aware entry assistance, bulk entry optimization, and anomaly detection. It will:

* Allow text-based data entry with NLP-based object recognition.
* Enable voice-based data entry in multiple local languages with AI-powered data element recognition.
* Enable image-based (OCR) capture of handwritten notes and auto-fill structured fields.
* Integrate seamlessly with DHIS2 while also functioning as a standalone app.
